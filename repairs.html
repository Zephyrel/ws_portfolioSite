      including especially Nintendo Switch Joycon and Steam Deck repairs/upgrades with drift-free Hall Effect Joysticks from Gulikit (or with the OEM factory junk, if one might prefer.)</p>
    
      <p>Additionally, I offer smartphone repairs for iPhone and Android devices, including battery replacement, glass repair, screen replacement,<br>
      and cleaning/software removal, and for those looking to get mote tech in their home, smarthome and securita camera installation services.<br><br>
