It's my website. Not a whole lot to say here for a read me but a TODO list and a few credits.

TODO:
    Refine text.
    Establish anchored link tags and javascript that shows up in the url and loads the correct page.
        i.e. "/index.html#aboutme" should always load up the about me, and clicking "About Me" to change the page should update the url in the address bar.
    (DONE) ~~Make Sidebar more media aware, make the sidebar a top bar on smaller width devices, i.e. mobile~~

    Add more pictures, create a gallery system I can slip into portions of the website.

    Implement a blog with Hexo. [ https://hexo.io ]
        I can deploy this to github pages or figure out how to deploy this to neocities.
