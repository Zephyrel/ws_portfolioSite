      <h1>Welcome to Russell Ferguson's Website and Portfolio.</h1>
      <p>I am a computer and network technician, web designer, and future indie game developer and independent business owner.
      Pardon our dust for the Work-In-Progress state of this website.</p>
      
      <p>If you've come to this website from Google through seeing a local business, from LinkedIn, Indeed.com, or from my Resume, you've come to the right place.<br>
      This is a central hub from where I can host all my assortment of professional works, and show you a little bit more about myself, with a click of a mouse to the links in the index on the left.
      </p>
      
      <p>"About Me" is where you can learn about me, my education, a bit of my life and my interests.</p>
      
      <p>"My Personal Setups" is where you can learn about the equipment I use in my day-to-day. My computers' OS, specs and maintenance automations, my software development environment for coding various projects, and a graph of my home network.</p>
      
      <p>"My Github" is exactly that: My personal code respository and the place I can keep an eye on my favorite FOSS projects and tools.
      As of 8/28/2023, I haven't personally publically opened and published the work I've done, college work or otherwise, but I am looking at declassifying my college work in the near future, with the removal of my full name in all projects, for my personal safety and privacy, as my Github is very public, whereas this portfolio website is less so. In the nearer future I'd like to refine and publish my Powershell/Chocolatey script for maintenance,
      and figure out what I can do with the Bungie.net API used for one of gaming's most successful live-service games, Destiny 2, for database and data science projects.</p>
      
      <p>"Repairs and Mods" is where you can go to see examples of my work on physical hardware, and get an idea of what I am capable of:<br>
      PC building, manual overclock tuning of CPUs, RAM frequency and timing, game console repair, controller modding, soldering work, I do quite a bit.</p>
         
      <p>If you wish to contact me for business or employment, my email is russellcf (AT) hotmail.com.<br>
      To contact me for repair work, please email 231russellcf (AT) gmail.com.<br></p>
      <p>Thank you for your time in stopping by.</p>
