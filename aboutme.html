        <main>
            <div class="layout">
                <p class="indent">I attended college at Missouri Western State University in St. Joseph, MO, starting in 2014.
                    After having a stellar high school track record, I was a student on the Dean's List at MWSU for a few years,
                    pursuing my education with a double major, a bachelor's in Computer Science Information Technologies,
                    and a bachelor's in Fine Arts Digital Animation, and a minor in Mathematics.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">However, life's struggles and bouts of intermittent homelessness, having chosen to stay behind in Missouri
                    to stick with my college education as my military family transferred to Germany,
                    as well as a new job as a Package Handler at UPS starting in 2016 and the new apartment I had gotten with the job,
                    made for a very tough time staying afloat in class. The unyielding schedule I had consisted of waking up before midnight, loading package trucks for several hours,
                    and trying to stay conscious in my classes during the day and in the early afternoon to code.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">I dropped pursuing my bachelor's in Fine Arts Digital Animation a few years in, to focus on the CompSci and Mathematics first,
                    and eventually dropped out of college towards the end of my 300-level courses burnt out with everything in 2019,
                    having had my fill of exhaustion from the physicality of my job at UPS, having picked up much
                    Java, SQL, Calculus 3, Linear Algebra, Statistics with R and Python, and a touch of C, Go and x86 Assembly
                    on the way to my unfortunate fall. I am currently planning to get back into education at Missouri S&T, and am working on
                    getting my CompTIA and Cisco certifications, after I get into a better job.
                </p>

                <p class="indent">I worked my way towards leaving UPS and my package loader position and joined Target, the retail chain, in July 2019
                    as a Tech and Mobile Sales Consultant while working UPS at the same time, getting the job after the
                    seasonal quarter ended in January 2020, and quitting UPS soon after.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">As of November 2023, after activating hundreds of phones and tweaking their settings for Consumer Cellular devices,
                    spending several years advising customers on all their tech purchases, wants and needs,
                    from theater and gaming to smart networking and security, I have parted ways and look towards moving forward.
                </p>

                <p class="indent">Outside of a history of misfortune and a life of work in a technologically lacking town, I've only gotten better with time.
                    I spend my time studying things in my interests such as game engine architecture and tinkering with software,
                    such as Arch Linux, openwrt on routers and coding tools, and hardware such as game consoles, computers, smartphones and routers alike.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">On the more enjoyable side of things to take the edge off, I spend my time outside of work enjoying the great wide world
                    of gaming, seeing the innovations smaller developers bring to the table and analyzing how their approach.
                    I competitively enjoy fighting games such as Street Fighter, Tekken and Skullgirls,
                    having a deep and longstanding appreciation for them both as a player and as a programmer.
                </p>
                
                <p class="indent">Other things I work to enjoy is streaming on Twitch, successfully enough to get
                    Affiliate, supporting my local fighting game community, planning new projects and scratching both my data-science itch and first-person-shooter itch
                    with Destiny 2 and Counter-Strike over the many years.
