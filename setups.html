      <h1>My Personal Home Systems, Network, and Workbench</h1>
      <p>Pardon our dust. This website's still under construction.</p>

      <p>"My Personal Setups" is where you can learn about the equipment I use in my day-to-day. My computers' OS, specs and maintenance automations,<br>
      my software development environment for coding various projects, and a graph of my home network.</p>
      <p>Here, essentially. Though you can still read all about it below, I do need to bring over the documentation and more pictures of my work here.<br>
      And I need to code the gallery script that can "blow up" the thumbnails in a nice fashion without redirecting you.</p>
      
      <p>My computer is a custom built PC running Windows 10 and Arch Linux side by side, still in a Cooler Master Haf X nearly a decade after the case's release. Oversized and<br>
      made of steel, the case boasts high airflow with fans back, top, front and on the side, pushing ambient air to cool it in a roomy case with great cable management<br>
      and ample space to work in, install accessories, and giving my monstrous GPU, CPU and 850w Power Supply room to breathe in.</p>
      
      <p>Motherboard: Asus Prime Z270-A. Mid-to-High end board designed for builders with overclocking goals and great cooling control.<br>
      CPU: Intel i7-7700k (which was cutting edge... for 2017), delidded and with better thermal material. Noctua. TheCPU is cooled with a<br>
      copper/aluminum heatsink and fan combo in the Cooler Master Hyper Evo 212, one I've used since the CPU has been on there.<br>
      Despite tweaks, the CPU is decisively not overclocked over 4.5Ghz for the amount of heat in excess of 90Â°C that AVX2 stress tests generate.<br>
      RAM: 2x16GB G.Skill Ripjaw RGB sticks, Hynix C-Die ICs, rated for DDR4-4000 at XMP, which it is running at, with a higher DRAM voltage manually set<br>
      than what the XMP profile would set, for stability. The system was unstable with XMP, forcing me to manually step through the OC myself.<br>
      Thankfully the sticks were good and they are running nicely, and not bottlenecking my GPU strongly.<br>
      GPU: Its an Asus Tuf Gaming Nvidia RTX 4070 TI OC with 12GB VRAM. The newest and strongest part of my PC, it works very fine in my otherwise aging build.<br>
      Storage: The rig is equipped with a 256GB Samsung SSD, and 2 7200RPM HDDs at 1TB and 4TB of storage. Not the most ideal but having a budget is important.<br>
      My PC is additionally equipped with an Elgato HD Game Capture card to capture video footage of gameplay for streaming and recording purposes, as part of my hobbies.</p>
      
      <p>On the network side of things, I have gigabit fiber and use a robust Netgear Nighthawk, plus an unmanaged switch for my game consoles to run in a DMZ,<br>
      to keep my apartment's network system running smooth altogether, and keeping me and my housemates' online gaming as low latency and lossless as possible by opening the NAT.<br>
      Additionally, I have some ports forwarded to open the NAT for running servers on occasion for certain programs and hosting games for me and my friends' enjoyment.</p>
      
      <p>Other computer equipment I have is a performance laptop equipped with an Intel i7 and an Nvidia 1050TI, a Samsung Tab A7, and a Samsung Galaxy S9+ as my phone.</p>
      
      <p>On the hardware repair side of things: I am going to have to get back here on that after logging my tools.</p>
      
      <p>Here's a picture of a stress test on the RAM after an overclock to DDR4-4000 with the GPU, an Asus Tuf Gaming Nvidia RTX 4070 TI OC<br>
      running in OCCT to generate load and produce heat, therefore testing the stability of the RAM in higher temps in a simulated gaming environment.
